# BIP-Tool
My early attempts at a simple project management/business operations/bookkeeping web tool.

I want to make a change and see if it gets uploaded to github

So this is my running server. Making any changes terrifies me. Still, I've done it before. Let's give it a go again. 

Goals: 
The main thing is that I need to change some value from 1000 to none. Specifically, DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS.
Based on how that's written, I'd say that has to do with the database, which adds a level of pita to it. 

While I have this all pulled to work on, I would also like to take care of a few small convenience things I've been salivating for. Get rid of all opening/closing columns. I don't use them and they're all stupid. 

I'd also like to make everything sortable by basically everything. Specifically, I want to sort tasks by date. That would help a great deal, especially if it can happen within the task view. 

Well, let's start by pulling these changes to readme
